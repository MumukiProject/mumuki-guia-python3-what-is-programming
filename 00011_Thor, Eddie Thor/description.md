In order to write code conveniently, we need a tool called a code editor. It's very similar to a text editor, but it's not suitable for writing poems, resumes, or school assignments. We won't use it to correct our spelling or to underline, bold or change colors of texts, but to create programs :star_struck:

Many of these code editors (or just editors, as of now) can be installed on your own computer. Some of them are:

* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/);
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/);
* [Atom](https://atom.io/);
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

For developing more complex applications and systems, there are even more comprehensive (and complex! :sweat:) tools known as Integrated Development Environments (_IDEs_). One of the most popular is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/en-us/pycharm/). There are also online _IDEs like [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), for which we don't need to download them to our computer :muscle:

But don't worry, for our first steps we don't need to install anything yet: Mumuki already provides you with an online code editor :globe_with_meridians:

> Now it's your turn: Write in Mumuki's code editor `I want to start programming now`.
