Maybe the difference between Ebay and Notepad is pretty obvious, but why do we say that some games are systems and others aren't?

Because of their complexity! Online games :cloud:, like _Fortnite_ and _Minecraft_, must allow thousands of people in different parts of the world to play at the same time :earth_americas:. However, this isn't the case with :black_joker: solitaire or :triangular_flag_on_post: minesweeper. But be careful, these aren't systems, but programs.

If the distinction isn't always so clear, don't worry. Sometimes, desktop or mobile applications are just the front doors to big systems, and we end up calling both the whole and the parts the same way.
