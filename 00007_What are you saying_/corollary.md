Great! Only the second sentence met the rules of the English language. However you could probably understand all of them despite the fact that in some:

* words may be misspelled; :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* punctuation marks may be missing;
* the sentence can be unordered;
* the words may be being used incorrectly (_vow_ exists but it is not the same as _how_).
