Although programming seems like an exact science, **programming is the art of making a computer solve our problems**.

Wait... Art? :scream: Yes! There are many ways to solve a problem, and finding them is a creative process :bulb:. The result of this process is a _program_: a description of a solution that can be _executed_ by a computer.

Knowing how to program gives us great power: instead of doing repetitive and boring tasks, **we use our knowledge and imagination to automate them** - fortunately, the computer doesn't get bored :wink:.

> Which of these problems do you think can be solved with programming?
