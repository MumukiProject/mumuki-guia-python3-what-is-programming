OK but why are there different languages if they're all used to give commands to a computer? :thinking: Just as there are many languages for cultural, geographical, and historical reasons (and of course they all serve to communicate between people :stuck_out_tongue:), there are different ways of saying the same thing throughout the world and the history of computers. :speaking_head:

While some languages are suitable for all kinds of problems (_general purpose languages_), others are suitable for very specific tasks. And as if that wasn't enough, each language has its fans :guitar: and its own community :loudspeaker:

Let's look at code examples doing the same thing in 3 different programming languages.

<i class="da da-python"></i> Python:

```python
def double(number):
	return number * 2
```

<i class="da da-javascript"></i> JavaScript:

```javascript
function double(number){
	return number * 2;
}
```

<i class="da da-ruby"></i> Ruby:

```ruby
def double(number)
   number * 2
end
```

> Which of the following codes do you think is written in Python?
